# Cross-Cutting Concerns

This folder contains guidance for concerns that span all phases of development. Unlike the phase-based documents, these apply throughout the entire software development lifecycle.

## How to Use

Cross-cutting concerns should be considered at every phase:

- **Requirements** — Identify security requirements, threat models
- **Design** — Build security into architecture, not as an afterthought
- **Development** — Follow secure coding practices
- **Testing** — Include security testing

Reference these documents alongside phase-specific guidance.
