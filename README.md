# Development Protocol

This collection of Markdown files provides a comprehensive overview of the software development process. It meticulously details the various stages and phases involved, along with best practices, conventions, patterns, and references to ensure the creation of a high-quality end product that is ready for production.

The primary objective is to maintain a purely Markdown-based structure, excluding any code. Pseudo-code and Mermaid diagrams are permitted. This approach guarantees compatibility with Large Language Models (LLMs) and serves as an invaluable guide for human developers learning software development.

While it may not be perfect, it aims to establish the foundational architecture that should be easy to scale and evolve for your specific product.
