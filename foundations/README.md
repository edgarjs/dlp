# Foundations

This folder contains the core concepts and meta-guidance that underpin the entire development protocol. These documents establish shared vocabulary, principles, and frameworks that are referenced throughout all subsequent phases.

## Purpose

Before diving into specific phases like requirements gathering or implementation, you need a common foundation:

- **Shared language** — Terms mean the same thing everywhere in this protocol
- **Guiding principles** — Core beliefs that inform every decision
- **Document literacy** — How to read and execute the protocol itself
- **Decision frameworks** — How to make choices when facing trade-offs

## Contents

| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [principles.md](principles.md)           | Core software development principles with guidance on when to apply and when to violate them |
| [terminology.md](terminology.md)         | Glossary of terms used throughout the protocol                                               |
| [document-format.md](document-format.md) | How to interpret checklists, decision trees, and templates in this protocol                  |
| [decision-making.md](decision-making.md) | Framework for making choices when multiple valid options exist                               |

## Reading Order

Read these documents in sequence before proceeding to any phase:

1. **terminology.md** — Establishes the vocabulary
2. **principles.md** — Establishes the values
3. **document-format.md** — Teaches you how to use this protocol
4. **decision-making.md** — Prepares you for trade-off situations

## How to Use This Folder

These documents are reference material. You will:

- **Read them once** at the start to internalize the concepts
- **Return to them** when you encounter unfamiliar terms or need to recall a principle
- **Reference them** when making decisions to ensure consistency with the protocol's philosophy

Cross-references throughout the protocol will link back to these foundations when relevant concepts apply.
